		<h1>Glioma Precautions and Dietary Recommendations</h1>
		<h2>Precautions</h2>
		<p>Follow the treatment plan recommended by your healthcare provider, which may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments.</p>
		<p>Attend regular follow-up appointments with your healthcare team to monitor the progress of your treatment and manage any potential side effects.</p>
		<p>Take steps to reduce exposure to environmental factors that may increase the risk of developing brain tumors, such as radiation and certain chemicals.</p>
		<h2>Dietary Recommendations</h2>
		<p>Consume a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to support overall health and immune function.</p>
		<p>Limit intake of processed foods, red meat, and foods high in saturated fats, as these may contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress.</p>
		<p>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.</p>
		<p>Consider incorporating anti-inflammatory foods such as fatty fish, nuts, seeds, and olive oil into your diet to help reduce inflammation and support brain health.</p>
