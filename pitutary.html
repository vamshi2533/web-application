		<h1>Pituitary Tumors Precautions and Dietary Recommendations</h1>
		<h2>Precautions</h2>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight">Follow your healthcare provider's recommendations</span> for treatment, which may include medication, surgery, or radiation therapy, depending on the type and size of the tumor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Monitor hormone levels regularly and adjust medication doses as needed to maintain hormonal balance.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Be vigilant for signs of hormonal imbalances, such as changes in vision, mood, or energy levels, and report them to your healthcare provider promptly.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Dietary Recommendations</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Maintain a healthy weight and avoid excessive calorie intake, as obesity may exacerbate symptoms related to hormonal imbalances.
			</li>
			<li>
				Consume a diet rich in fiber, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to support digestive health and regulate blood sugar levels.
			</li>
			<li>
				Limit intake of foods high in refined sugars and carbohydrates, as these may contribute to insulin resistance and hormone fluctuations.
			</li>
			<li>
				Monitor sodium intake and avoid excessive salt consumption, as it may exacerbate symptoms such as fluid retention and high blood pressure.
			</li>
		</ul>
