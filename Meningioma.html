		<h1>Meningioma Precautions and Dietary Recommendations</h1>
		<h2>Precautions</h2>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight">Follow your healthcare provider's recommendations</span> for monitoring the tumor's growth and any symptoms associated with it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Be aware of potential signs of complications, such as <span class="highlight">seizures, vision changes, or cognitive difficulties</span>, and seek prompt medical attention if they occur.
		</p>
		<p>
			Avoid activities that may increase intracranial pressure, such as heavy lifting or straining.
		</p>
		<h2>Dietary Recommendations</h2>
		<p>
			Consume a well-balanced diet consisting of a variety of <span class="highlight">nutrient-rich foods</span> to support overall health and immune function.
		</p>
		<p>
			Include foods rich in <span class="highlight">antioxidants</span>, such as berries, leafy greens, and brightly colored vegetables, to help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Limit intake of <span class="highlight">sodium</span> and processed foods, as excess salt may contribute to fluid retention and increased intracranial pressure.
		</p>
		<p>
			Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of <span class="highlight">fluids</span>, but avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption, as these may exacerbate symptoms such as headaches.
